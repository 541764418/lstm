# Example LSTM Models for timeseries prediction

This repo contains 4 examples of DeepLearning LSTMs for doing timeseries prediction. This is a simple model used to predict sine waves.
Each of these examples has the code for training the model as well as a jupyter notebook anlayzing the accuracy.

The 4 examples are:
- pytorch

  - https://github.com/thepaulm/lstm/blob/master/pytorch%20LSTM.ipynb
- keras
  - https://github.com/thepaulm/lstm/blob/master/basic_keras.py
  - https://github.com/thepaulm/lstm/blob/master/Keras%20LSTM.ipynb
- tensorflow.contrib.keras
  - https://github.com/thepaulm/lstm/blob/master/basic_keras_tf.py
  - https://github.com/thepaulm/lstm/blob/master/Keras%20TF%20LSTM.ipynb
- tensorflow

  - https://github.com/thepaulm/lstm/blob/master/TensorFlow%20LSTM.ipynb

Everything else in here is garbage / failed experiments :).
